      <h2>What I wanted to understand</h2>
      <p>
        I live in New York City, where it sometimes feels like people spend more
        on eating out than on actual products. I wanted to see if that feeling
        connects to how the city is built and how people live in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of just guessing, I looked at three simple pieces of city data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Income level:</strong> how higher income changes spending.</li>
        <li><strong>Restaurant density:</strong> how many places to eat are around.</li>
        <li><strong>Apartment size:</strong> how much space people have for stuff.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
      <p class="hypothesis">
        People in New York City spend more money on eating out than on shopping
        because they earn more, have restaurants everywhere, and live in small
        apartments with limited storage.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION 1 · INCOME -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>1 · Income: when money makes convenience normal</h2>
      <p>
        New Yorkers in higher income brackets often work long hours and have
        less time to cook. When money and time don’t match, people buy
        convenience—quick meals, takeout, and coffee—rather than spending that
        same money on more products.
      </p>

      <h3>What I plotted</h3>
      <p>
        Below is a simple breakdown of <strong>estimated yearly spending</strong>
        on eating out vs shopping for three income groups. The exact numbers are
        rounded and simplified, but they follow the pattern seen in national
        spending surveys: as income goes up, money for eating out grows faster
        than money for products.
      </p>

      <div class="chart-frame">
        <h4>Eating out vs shopping by income group</h4>
        <canvas id="incomeChart"></canvas>
        <p class="chart-caption">
          Each group shows example yearly spending per household. Higher income
          households put more of their budget into eating out than into buying
          products.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What this suggests for NYC</h3>
      <p>
        In a high-income city like NYC, there are many people in the “middle”
        and “high” income ranges. For them, paying for prepared food becomes a
        normal daily choice, not a rare treat. Eating out starts to feel like
        the default, while shopping stays flatter.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2 · RESTAURANT DENSITY -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>2 · Restaurant density: when food is always a few steps away</h2>
      <p>
        NYC is full of places to eat—restaurants, delis, bodegas, and fast
        casual spots. When food is always close by, the easiest option is to
        grab something outside, not to go home, cook, or spend time browsing
        stores for products.
      </p>

      <h3>What I plotted</h3>
      <p>
        Here, each dot is a city. The
        <strong>x-axis</strong> shows restaurants per 10,000 residents. The
        <strong>y-axis</strong> is a simple index of eating-out spending
        (100 = U.S. average). These values are rounded and illustrative, but
        they mirror lists that show NYC and other dense cities near the top for
        restaurant counts.
      </p>

      <div class="chart-frame">
        <h4>More restaurants nearby → more money spent on eating out</h4>
        <canvas id="densityChart"></canvas>
        <p class="chart-caption">
          Cities with more restaurants per person tend to sit higher on the
          eating-out index. NYC appears in the top-right area: lots of
          restaurants, lots of spending on eating out.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What this suggests for NYC</h3>
      <p>
        In New York, you rarely have to plan ahead to find food. Convenience is
        built into the streets. When restaurants are everywhere, the city
        quietly encourages people to spend money on meals instead of taking the
        time to shop and cook at home.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3 · SMALL SPACES -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>3 · Small apartments: less room for stuff, more room for going out</h2>
      <p>
        Compared to the U.S. average, NYC apartments are small. With less
        storage, people simply can’t keep as many clothes, decor pieces, or
        random products. Owning less becomes a practical decision, not just an
        aesthetic one.
      </p>

      <h3>What I plotted</h3>
      <p>
        This chart compares rounded averages of <strong>apartment size in
        square feet</strong> for several cities and the U.S. overall. New York
        sits below the national average, while some cities, like Dallas, are
        noticeably larger.
      </p>

      <div class="chart-frame">
        <h4>Average apartment size: NYC vs other cities</h4>
        <canvas id="spaceChart"></canvas>
        <p class="chart-caption">
          NYC rentals are smaller than the U.S. average and smaller than some
          other big-city units. Less space means less storage for products,
          which pushes some spending away from “buying stuff” and toward
          experiences like eating out.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>What this suggests for NYC</h3>
      <p>
        When your apartment is small, every new item is a decision. That reality
        makes it easier to say “no” to more things and “yes” to going out. Food
        doesn’t need a closet, a drawer, or a shelf—it’s consumed and gone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <section class="section conclusion">
      <h2>What all three pieces say together</h2>
      <p>
        Each part of this story looks at a different side of city life. When
        you line them up—income, restaurant density, and apartment size—they all
        point in the same direction.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Income:</strong> more money makes it easier to pay for convenience and quick meals.</li>
        <li><strong>Restaurant density:</strong> many nearby options make eating out the easiest choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Small spaces:</strong> limited storage makes people more selective about products.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Together, these factors support the idea that New Yorkers are nudged
        toward spending more on eating out than on shopping. It’s not just about
        personal preference. The city’s money, layout, and housing all push
        spending toward food and experiences instead of more stuff.
      </p>

      <p class="closing-line">
        In a place like New York City, <strong>how you spend is shaped by where
        you live</strong> as much as by what you like.
